# Network Analysis of "Les Miserables"
The project aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the "Les Miserables" dataset, inspired by Victor Hugo's masterpiece, through the lens of Network representation.

The analysis focused on key descriptive characteristics such as Degree, Strength, Betweenness, and Transitivity within the network. Notably, the examination revealed the central role of the main character, Jean Valjean, within the network.

Subsequently, Degree Distribution Analysis was conducted to identify the most suitable model for elucidating the network's underlying structure.

The exploration extended to Clustering Analysis, where various methods were explored to discern the optimal approach for partitioning the network into distinct communities.

In a unique approach, traditional clustering algorithms were bypassed in favor of leveraging insights from the dataset itself, particularly the Chapter Label. This approach unveiled intriguing insights into how the network's characteristics varied across different chapters, shedding light on the distribution of characters throughout the book.
